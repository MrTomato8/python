          <p>OpenTechSchool is a community initiative to provide programming and other tech-related workshops to women and their friends. We take care of the organizational side of things (venues, press, finding participants) and let our volunteer coaches to create the curriculum according to their vision. Our main goal is to create a friendly and safe learning environment where no one feels shy about asking any question. Everyone, no matter what their gender, skill level or experience, is invited to participate, whether as a coach or a learner. OTS is an idea we would be very happy to see spread across the globe!
