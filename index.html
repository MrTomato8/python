    <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="cols">We, a group of python coaches, from Berlin would like to spread the joy of programming with Python. So we decided to give introduction workshops as well as on-going python beginners workshops on special topics on a regular bases. At the moment we are in progress of creating the material for the beginners course as well as the follow up workshops. But we'll present some more details here shortly.</p>

    <h2>Introduction Afternoon</h2>
    <div class="container_small">
      <p>But if you are interested in learning programming, you probably want to mark <strong>1st of September 2012</strong> in your calendars already. Because on that afternoon we'll be hosting our first <strong>Introduction to programming with PythonTurtle</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>We'll organise the event using <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ots-beginners-meetup/">the OTS meetup group</a>, so you might wanna sign up for that already, too.</p>

      <h3>Schedule</h3>
      <p>This introduction workshop will consist of two parts: the friday evening and the saturday afternoon.
      </p>
      <h4>Friday evening</h4>
      <p>We organise a little gettogether and install party. If you don't have Python 2.7 on your laptop just yet, bring it by and we install it together. It is not mandatory to come to this meeting but it also gives you the chance to get to the coaches as well as other participants in relaxed and casual environment upfront. Well, and to get the requirements done ;) .</p>
      <h4>Satuday afternoon</h4>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon we gather together to get our hands dirty. We'll be meeting at 2pm and, start with a quick introduction by one of the coaches, who's also taking you through what we want to do that afternoon and then head right into hacking our first little scripts and programs using the awesome <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/turtle.html">Turtle in python</a>.
